# Causal Lab

A small tool that lets someone with a panel dataset and a treatment date find out — with real numbers, not a guess — whether a difference-in-differences design is even appropriate for their data, and if so, run it correctly.

## 1. The demo

I open the app in the browser and upload a CSV: one row per unit per time period, a treatment date, and an outcome column. It shows a plot of average outcomes for treated and untreated units over time, with the treatment date marked. Below it, a diagnosis panel says "Parallel trends: questionable — pre-trend slope difference is 0.34, p = 0.02" and "Recommended: difference-in-differences, but check anticipation effects first." I click "Run DiD" and it shows a coefficient, a standard error, and a two-way fixed-effects regression table. I click "Break this design" and it re-runs the same estimator on a version of the data where I know the true effect is zero, so I can see whether the method still finds a false effect.

If I don't have real data, I click "Generate a synthetic world" first: it creates a panel with a known, chosen treatment effect, so I can check that the estimator recovers close to that number before trusting it on anything real.

## 2. The shape

```
in            a panel CSV (unit, time, outcome, treatment indicator) —
              real data or a synthetic dataset generated in-app with a
              known true effect
out           a diagnosis of whether parallel trends plausibly hold,
              a DiD coefficient with standard error, and a plot
on screen     upload or generate → see the pre/post trend plot and the
              diagnosis → run the estimator → see the result next to
              the true effect if the data was synthetic
```

## 3. The size

**Delivered:**
- Generate a synthetic panel dataset with a chosen, known treatment effect (the "virtual world"), with a Causal Threats Generator to add confounding, spillovers, serial correlation, staggered adoption, and treatment-effect heterogeneity at a chosen intensity.
- Accept an uploaded CSV in the same panel shape, validated against the five required columns at upload time — a missing column is reported by name instead of failing later.
- Plot treated vs. untreated average outcomes over time.
- Check pre-treatment trends and report a plain-language verdict ("plausible" / "questionable" / "violated") with the number behind it, as one of five checks in a "Break My Design" stress-test battery (parallel trends, anticipation, spillovers, serial correlation, heterogeneous effects) that also reports an overall Identification Strength score.
- Run a two-way fixed-effects DiD estimator and report the coefficient, standard error, and p-value.
- Run an Event Study (leads-and-lags) estimator and plot dynamic, period-by-period treatment effects around the treatment date.
- Score seven candidate causal-identification methods (RCT, DiD, Event Study, Synthetic Control, RDD, IV, Matching) against the declared research design with a transparent, explainable Method Suitability Score, and recommend the best fit — the app shows its work rather than picking silently.
- Generate ready-to-run Python, R, and Stata scripts that reproduce the DiD analysis.
- Run in English or French, switchable from the sidebar at any time.
- When run on synthetic data, show the estimate next to the true effect that was used to generate it, including a Monte Carlo mode that reports bias, RMSE, and confidence-interval coverage across many replications.

**Not this term:**
- IV, RDD, matching, synthetic control, RCT, DML as actual estimators — the method-recommendation engine scores and explains all seven, but only DiD and Event Study are implemented as estimators you can actually run.
- Report export (PDF/Word/LaTeX).
- Connectors to external data sources (DHS, ACLED, WorldPop, etc.).
- Project persistence / saved sessions.

A person with a messy panel CSV and a treatment date can use this version alone: upload, see whether parallel trends look reasonable, get a DiD estimate. Nothing else needs to exist for that to be useful — everything above it is additional, not a prerequisite for it.

## 4. How we would know it works

- Given a synthetic dataset generated with a treatment effect of, say, 2.0, the DiD estimator reports a coefficient within a reasonable margin of 2.0.
- Given a panel CSV missing the treatment indicator column, the app reports an error naming that column instead of running.
- Given a synthetic dataset built with deliberately diverging pre-trends (violated parallel trends), the diagnosis panel flags it as "questionable" or "violated," not "plausible."
- Given any panel run through the event-study estimator, its coefficient for the period immediately before treatment (k = -1, the reference period) is exactly zero by construction.
- Given a research design declared with random assignment, the method recommendation ranks Randomized Controlled Trial above every other candidate method.
- Given panel data with a control unit directly adjacent to a treated unit, the "Break My Design" Spillovers check reports WARNING with the count and share of adjacent controls, and the overall Identification Strength score is below 100.
- Given the same column names, the generated Python, R, and Stata scripts all fit the same two-way fixed-effects model with standard errors clustered on the same column.
- Switching the sidebar language toggle from EN to FR redraws every page's text in French, falling back to English for any translation key that's missing.

## 5. What could stop this

- **Statistical correctness under review.** I have used DiD in coursework but never implemented the estimator (and its standard errors) from scratch for arbitrary panel shapes — unbalanced panels, staggered treatment timing, and clustering are all places I could get the math wrong without noticing. I will validate every estimator against a known R/Python package (e.g., `linearmodels` or `fixest`) on the same synthetic data before trusting my own numbers.
- **Real data availability.** I don't yet have a real panel dataset I'm allowed to show in class. The demo will run on the synthetic "virtual world" generator by default; if I obtain a usable real dataset later (course data, a public panel dataset), I'll add it, but the project does not depend on it.
- **Scope creep, and it already happened.** The original version of this idea had ten modules and two languages; this README initially cut it to one estimator and one diagnosis specifically to avoid that. The tripwire fired anyway: event study, cross-method recommendation, the full stress-test battery, code generation, and the French interface were all built before the four core acceptance criteria above were validated against a known package. Section 3 now documents what was actually delivered instead of leaving this README stale about it — but the underlying risk is unchanged: the four original acceptance criteria are still the real bar, and nothing on the delivered list above substitutes for validating the estimator itself.
